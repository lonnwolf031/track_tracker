# track_tracker

A new Flutter project.

## Development notes

I started this project for someone I know whom as a therapist wanted to track stress with clients via a heartrate monitor (over bluetooth). It was a proven concept, but only expensive subscription-based services existed for this.

### Current state of development

Figuring out how to get desired data from bluetooth heart rate monitor (bluetooth protocols)
